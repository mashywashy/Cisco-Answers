1. Network Configuration and Connectivity

- IPv4 Address of Your Device: 192.168.1.105 
- Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1 

- IPv4 Address of Your Router: 192.168.1.1 

a. What does the connection look like between your device and your router? Is it wired or wireless? 
The connection is wireless, as my device connects to the router via Wi-Fi. 

b. Where is the router that your device uses to access the internet? 
The router is located in the living room, positioned near the modem to ensure strong connectivity throughout the house. 

c. What does the connection look like between your router and the internet? 
The router is connected to the internet via a fiber-optic cable provided by the ISP. The fiber line runs through an outdoor junction box connected to a nearby utility pole. 

d. What is the IP address for your ISPâ€™s POP (Point of Presence)? 
2nd Hop IPv4 Address: 203.119.4.25 
ISP: Globe Telecom 
City: Quezon City 
Region: National Capital Region 
Country: Philippines 

e. What is the IPv4 address of the 3rd hop in the traceroute output? 
10.245.77.132 

f. Which router and interface in the monterey.ca building is configured with this IPv4 address? 
Router: rur03.monterey.ca.sfba.comcast.net 
Interface: GigabitEthernet0/1 

g. What is the IPv4 address of the 4th hop in the traceroute output? 
10.152.64.99 

h. Which router and interface in the monterey.ca building is configured with this IPv4 address? 
Router: rur04.monterey.ca.sfba.comcast.net 
Interface: GigabitEthernet0/1 

i. Why do you think the IP addresses for the other interfaces are not shown in the traceroute output? 
The interfaces that do not appear in the traceroute output are the internal router interfaces responsible for forwarding packets. Traceroute only displays the IP addresses of next-hop routers rather than the source interfaces within those routers. 

j. List the hops in your own traceroute output that belong to your local ISP. 
- 203.119.4.25 (Globe Telecom Quezon City) 
- 203.119.4.57 (Globe Core Network) 
- 122.52.36.1 (Globe Peering Router) 

2. Internet Infrastructure and Submarine Cables 

a. What information, if any, can you decipher from the domain names for your local ISP? 
The domain names reveal the geographical location, type of router, and interface types used by the ISP. For example, core1.manila.globe.com.ph suggests that it is a core router in Manila used by Globe. 

b. What is the interface for the 10th hop? 
GigabitEthernet0/2 

c. What speed is the Internet2 backbone that provides connections between its members? 
Internet2 provides a 100 Gbit/s network backbone, connecting over 210 U.S. educational institutions, corporations, and government agencies. 

d. What is the interface used for the 11th hop in the traceroute output? 
GigabitEthernet0/1 

e. Search for submarine cables that land at both Hermosa Beach and Hawaii. How many submarine cables terminate at Hermosa Beach? 
At present, four submarine cables terminate at Hermosa Beach: 
- HKA (Hong Kong-Americas) 
- JUPITER 
- SEA-US 
- FASTER 

f. What is the name of the submarine cable that runs from Hermosa Beach to Hawaii? 
The SEA-US submarine cable system. 

g. What is the name of the landing point in Hawaii? 
Makaha Cable Landing Station 

h. How many submarine cables terminate at this landing point in Hawaii? 
Currently, five submarine cables terminate at Makaha: 
- SEA-US 
- Japan-U.S. Cable Network (JUS) 
- HIFN (Hawaii Island Fibre Network) 
- Paniolo Cable Network 
- Pacific Light Cable Network (PLCN) 

i. How far apart are submarine cable repeaters? 
Typically, repeaters on submarine cables are spaced 70 to 100 km apart, depending on the cable technology and transmission power. 

j. What is the interface assigned to the 12th hop in the traceroute output? 
GigabitEthernet0/2 

k. In Packet Tracer, what interface is assigned to the 13th hop (kolanut-re0.uhnet.net router)? 
GigabitEthernet0/1
