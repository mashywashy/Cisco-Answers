Number of hosts that can be connected using this module: 4

Module to provide a Gigabit optical connection to Switch3: PT-SWITCH-NM-1FGE
Step 2: Add the correct modules and power up devices.

Slot into which the module was inserted on Switch2: GigabitEthernet5/1
Part 3: Connect Devices

Part 4: Check Connectivity

Step 1: Check the interface status on East.

Expected output of show ip interface brief command:
Code
Interface             IP-Address        OK?  Method  Status      Protocol
GigabitEthernet0/0    172.30.1.1        YES  manual  up          up
GigabitEthernet0/1    172.31.1.1        YES  manual  up          up
Serial0/0/0           10.10.10.1        YES  manual  up          up
Serial0/0/1           unassigned        YES  unset   down        down
FastEthernet0/1/0     unassigned        YES  unset   up          up
FastEthernet0/1/1     unassigned        YES  unset   up          up
FastEthernet0/1/2     unassigned        YES  unset   up          up
FastEthernet0/1/3     unassigned        YES  unset   up          down
Vlan1                 172.29.1.1        YES  manual  up          up
Step 2: Connect wireless devices, Laptop and TabletPC.

Expected outcome: Wireless connection should appear, and web access should be verified by displaying Cisco Packet Tracer page.
Step 3: Change the access method of the TabletPC.

Expected outcome: Cellular connection should appear, and web access should be verified.
Step 4: Check connectivity of the other PCs.

Expected outcome: All PCs should have connectivity to the website and each other.
